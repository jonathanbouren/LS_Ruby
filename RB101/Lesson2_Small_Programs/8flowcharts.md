Flowcharts are visible representations of pseudo-code that lays out the logic of programs in a logical sequence. 
Flowchart components include the following

Mapping or drawing out the iteration logic step by step is called imperative or procedural problem solving. 

Using pre-defined methods to solve basic problems, such as using #each to iterate over an array, is known as the declarative way to solve a problem. 

Using an imperative approach will help you think like a computer.



Sub-Processes are introduced to help maintain a "High-Level" view of the program. The high-level view assumes that the sub processes will work, without going into great detail for them.

In this example, num = find_largest(collection) is a sub-process. It refers to a process that will be completed and the program will continue. This is done without defining in great detail how the sub-process works. Defining the sub-process can be done in greater detail in another flow chart. This allows the program to be viewed in a 'high-level'.
