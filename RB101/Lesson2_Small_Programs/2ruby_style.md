Ruby Style

When writing ruby code use the following style conventions so the code follows a legible, repeatable format. 

1. Tabs should always be set to two spaces. And indenting should always be 2 spaces as well. 

2. When writing single line comments, use the hashtag 

   #this is a comment 

   when writing comments that span multiple lines use =begin =end 

3. When defining or initialising a method, always use snake_case. 

4. When representing a value in your program that will not change, define a constant variable. Constants are defined with ALL CAPS. 

5. When working with do...end pairs, prefer {} when the entire code expression fits on one line. 

6. When declaring a class name, use CamelCase.
