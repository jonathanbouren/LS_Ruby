Truthiness

A **boolean** is an object whose only purpose is to express true or false.

In Ruby, booleans are represented by the true and false objects.

 **True** and **False** have real classes, like any other object and methods can be called on them.

**short circuiting ** the && and || operators will "short circuit" if they can guarantee the return value, meaning they will not continue to evaluate the expression.

Ruby considers everything to be "truthy" other than false and nil.
